## [0.3.2] - SNMP compatibility

### Added

- Added SNMP management compatibility to Logstash Agent.
- Added support for applying multiple managed solution configurations in a single agent update cycle.
- Added ±10-second jitter to agent check-ins to reduce synchronized polling across large deployments.
- Added logging when Logstash keystore values are cleared.
- Added a post-installation `configure` command for environments where Logstash is installed after the initial Logstash Agent setup.
- Added support for Logstash source installations and other nonstandard installation layouts.
- Added further test coverage for newly introduced SNMP and Logstash Agent functionality.

### Changed

- Updated Logstash compatibility to 9.4.3 for LogstashUI 0.5.x.
- Changed policy application so agent and network policies are combined before being applied, preventing multiple Logstash restarts.
- Refactored policy application to support future solutions managed by Logstash Agent.
- Changed keystore handling so removing values no longer restarts Logstash.
- Keystore changes now restart Logstash only when values are created or updated.
- Normalized keystore key casing to prevent values from being rewritten continuously.
- Updated the installer to repair `/var/log` permissions when Logstash is not installed.
- Removed the requirement for Logstash to be installed and managed through `systemd` during initial setup.
- Updated installation behavior to support source builds and nonstandard Logstash installations.
- Moved controller logger initialization to the top of the module.

### Fixed

- Fixed an incorrect default port in the agent configuration and updated the related documentation.
- Fixed agent policies being applied before network policies, which caused Logstash to restart twice.
- Fixed repeated keystore writes caused by inconsistent key-name casing.
- Fixed installation failures caused by incorrect `/var/log` permissions when Logstash was not already installed.

## [0.3.1] - Simulation Slot Fixes and Port Update - 06/07/2026

### Added

### Changed

- Updated the default LogstashAgent port from `9600` to `9650` to avoid conflicts with Logstash monitoring APIs.

### Fixed

- Fixed an import issue that could occur when simulation slots were being deallocated.
- Fixed an issue where simulation slots were not properly evicted when a new pipeline needed to take over an existing slot.
- Fixed simulation flow so slot eviction properly waits for the new pipeline to be backfilled before continuing.

## [0.3.0] - Logstash Agent - ARM Compatibility - 05/14/2026

### Added

- Added ARM Docker image builds to the GitHub Actions workflow after successful test completion.

### Changed

- Incremented the application version number.
- Updated the preferred Logstash Agent version preemptively for the next release.
